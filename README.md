# qiskit_examples
<p>I'll post here a number of Qiskit Examples I adapted to my needs or wrote myself. 
The purpose is to document my exploration of quantum computing. 
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  Directory named <i>adapted</i> contains jupyter notebooks I adapted from existing examples. 
<br/>
  Directory named <i>original</i> contains jupyter notebooks I wrote myself. 
<br/>
</p>
<p>
Hopefully, this is also useful to other people.
