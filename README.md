# qiskit_examples
I'll post here a number of Qiskit Examples I adapted to my needs or wrote myself. The purpose is to document my exploration of quantum computing. Directory adapted contains jupyter notebooks I adapted from existing examples. Directory original contains jupyter notebooks I wrote myself. Hopefully, this is also useful to other people.
