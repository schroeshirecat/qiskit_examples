# qiskit_examples
<p>I'll post here a number of Qiskit Examples I adapted to my needs or wrote myself. 
The purpose is to document my exploration of quantum computing.

Directory adapted contains jupyter notebooks I adapted from existing examples. 
<br/>
Directory original contains jupyter notebooks I wrote myself.

Hopefully, this is also useful to other people.
